#Microsoft Hack Knight 2016

###Outline
The purpose of this project is to create a community sourced event page to help UCF students find events near them in a form more accessable than the official UCF event page.

Using the google maps API, we intend to have an interactive map and event list that allows users to see events nearby that they might be interested in. At first we are pulling the information directly from the official ucf page but hope to allow users to add their own events in the future.

A pin will not necesarily represent an event, but a place where events are held. Upon selecting the pin, a list of events taking place there is displayed.
